# Phishing Detection Tool Using Machine Learning

This project leverages machine learning techniques to detect phishing emails by analyzing their content. The tool employs a Random Forest Classifier trained on a cleaned dataset of emails. The application includes a graphical user interface (GUI) for user-friendly interaction and functionalities to preprocess text, train models, and make predictions.

## Features

- **Email Classification**: Classifies emails as phishing or not phishing based on textual analysis.
- **Data Preprocessing**: Cleans and prepares raw email data for analysis.
- **Model Training**: Trains a Random Forest Classifier on the cleaned dataset.
- **GUI Interface**: User-friendly interface for inputting text and displaying results.
- **Model Persistence**: Saves the trained model and vectorizer for future use.

## Technical Details

1. **Data Cleaning**: 
   - The script `dataset_clean.py` is responsible for loading the dataset, removing duplicates, and handling missing values. It ensures that the dataset is ready for analysis by normalizing the email body text.
   
2. **Text Vectorization**: 
   - The `TfidfVectorizer` from the scikit-learn library transforms the cleaned text data into numerical format, allowing the machine learning model to process it. This vectorization represents the importance of words in the emails.

3. **Random Forest Classifier**: 
   - The `RandomForestClassifier` is used to train the model on the processed dataset. It works by creating multiple decision trees and aggregating their predictions to improve accuracy and robustness.

4. **Model Training and Prediction**: 
   - The script `ml_model_trainer.py` handles the training of the model and evaluates its performance. It splits the dataset into training and testing sets, fits the model, and saves the trained model and vectorizer using `joblib`.

5. **GUI for Predictions**: 
   - The `anti-phisher.py` script implements the GUI. It allows users to input email content and displays the prediction results based on the trained model.
