# Phishing Detection Tool

This project is a Machine Learning-based tool designed to identify phishing emails based on their textual content. By preprocessing email text, vectorizing it, and applying a **Random Forest Classifier**, the tool effectively distinguishes phishing emails from legitimate ones.

## Features
- **Preprocessing**: Removes unwanted characters, HTML tags, and URLs, preparing the text for analysis.
- **TF-IDF Vectorization**: Converts text into numerical features, capturing the importance of terms.
- **Phishing Detection Model**: A trained **Random Forest Classifier** that classifies emails as phishing or not phishing based on trained features.
- **Graphical User Interface (GUI)**: Built with Tkinter, making it user-friendly for analyzing email text.

## Technical Details

1. **Dataset Cleaning and Preprocessing**:
   - Uses regular expressions to remove unwanted content, making the dataset suitable for training.
2. **TF-IDF Vectorizer**:
   - Utilizes the TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency) method to convert text into numerical values.
3. **Random Forest Classifier**:
   - The Random Forest model, a popular machine learning algorithm, is trained to classify email text, based on patterns learned from the training data.
4. **Model Saving and Loading**:
   - The trained model and vectorizer are saved as `.pkl` files, allowing quick re-use without re-training.
5. **GUI for Predictions**:
   - Built with Tkinter, enabling users to input email text and receive instant phishing detection results.

## Setup and Installation

1. **Clone the repository**:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/phishing-detection-tool.git
    cd phishing-detection-tool
    ```

2. **Install dependencies**:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
   Ensure that `pandas`, `scikit-learn`, `joblib`, `tkinter`, and `re` are installed.

3. **Place Model Files**:
   Ensure `phishing_detection_model.pkl` and `tfidf_vectorizer.pkl` are in the project directory for seamless access.

## How to Run

### Running on Windows
1. **Data Preprocessing and Model Training (Script 1 & 2)**:
   - Open a terminal in the project directory.
   - Run `data_processing_script.py` to preprocess your dataset.
   - Run `model_training_script.py` to train and save the model (Note: update the dataset path in the script).

   ```bash
   python data_processing_script.py
   python model_training_script.py
   ```

2. **Phishing Detection GUI (Script 3)**:
   - Run `phishing_detection_gui.py` to open the GUI.
   - Enter the email text in the provided input field and press "Predict" to receive phishing detection results.

   ```bash
   python phishing_detection_gui.py
   ```

### Example Use
   - Input: Email content (text).
   - Output: Classification as "Phishing" or "Not Phishing."
